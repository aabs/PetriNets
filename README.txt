Welcome to PetriNets
====================

PetriNets is a Petri Net library written in C# and designed to act as the core
of an event driven application. 

This project follows on from a blog post I made [1] some years ago that still seems to be popular today. In working with the systems designed in [1] I found that the inherent limitations of DFAs were an actual and continual limitation in the working of the system I had produced. I saught a mechanism whereby I could provide assurances of the consistency of my state models in the face of errors. pETRInETS
